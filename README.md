# seHTTPd

`seHTTPd` implements a small and efficient web server with 1K lines of C code.
I/O multiplexing is achieved using [epoll](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html).

## Features

* Single-threaded, non-blocking I/O based on event-driven model
* HTTP persistent connection (HTTP Keep-Alive)
* A timer for executing the handler after having waited the specified time

## Build from Source

At the moment, `seHTTPd` supports Linux based systems with epoll system call.
Building `seHTTPd` is straightforward.
```shell
$ make
```

By default the server accepts connections on port 8081, if you want to assign
other port for the server, modify file `src/mainloop.c` and build again.
